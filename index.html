        <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

        <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
        <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <img src="images/chief.jpg" alt="Pomeranian looking at camera with head bowed" width="400"> 
            <p>
                Chief is a 9 year old pomeranian who loves to sleep as much as he can. He naps anywhere, ranging from someone's bed to the grass outside. He enjoys walking outside, but keep watch of him, otherwise he will try to consume geese poop.
            </p>
            <p>
                He does not like any toys anymore as when he was younger, he watched a bigger toy shred his favorite one to pieces. He used to know how to roll over, but now replaced that memory with a spin as it is much easier.
            </p>

            <h2 class = sticky>Maui</h2>
            <img src="images/maui.jpeg" alt="He is a mini doodle with brown/blond hair " width=400>
            <p>Maui is a two-year-old mini-doodle who thinks he is as big as a German shepherd. This mindset allows him to voice his opinion, especially when demanding food or attention. He is also a classic momma's boy, as he has learned if he is annoying enough, he can get anything he demands. </p>
            <p>During his lounging time, he gets to the highest chair he can get on and stares outside, waiting either for guests or belly rubs. He also has the tendency to force his mother to go to sleep as soon as his father goes to bed.</p>

            <img src="images/cookysmiley.jpg" alt="White and gray Bernedoodle sitting on a couch and smiling.
            " width=400>
            <p>Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling off in the garage.
        </p>
            <p>He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.</p>

            <img src="images/hachi_onlawn.jpg" alt="Akita named Hachi sitting on the front lawn
            " width=400>
            <p>Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He’s a very old boy who likes to play in snow and run laps around our yard. He is super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and will always come and greet visitors with a smile and a few barks.

        </p>
            <p>Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it when other dogs steal attention from him and he will lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with another dog, a small poodle, he would constantly bicker with the poodle when it was being loud.

            <h2 class = sticky>Milo</h2>
            <img src="images/Nickels_Adoption_Day.png" alt="Akita named Hachi sitting on the front lawn
            " width=400>
            <p>Milo is a 6 year old schnoodle. He is super energetic and his favorite game is fetch, which he wants to play all the time — yes, even when it’s pitch black outside or the weather is unideal. Milo is also loving and kind, at least to humans. When he’s around other dogs, he is either jealous of the attention they’re receiving, or ignores them because he has other priorities (chasing a ball).


        </p>
            <p>Milo is also a pretty smart dog, although he doesn't always use it for good. He can roll over on command, and use his sense of scent to find a hidden treat. But he’s also figured out some loopholes to get what he wants. For example, he has been trained to nudge the bell near the front door to indicate that he needs to be walked. Recently, though, he’s learned that he can just pretend like he wants to go on a walk, but instead lead us around the house to the backyard so he can play. In case it wasn’t clear: Milo loves to play. Although he can be sneaky, my family loves him more than anything.

            <img src="images/cooper.jpeg" alt="Akita named Hachi sitting on the front lawn
            " width=400>
            <p>Cooper is an 8yr old border collie and lab mix. We rescued him from the Humane Society as a puppy! He loves going on long walks/runs, but he stops to sniff something every few steps. He’s pretty friendly, but he loves to loudly bark at delivery people who ring the doorbell. 



        </p>
            <p>Whenever it’s movie night, Cooper has to join on the couch/bed or he feels left out. He loves to cuddle and pats on his tummy. Cooper will play fetch for about 2 or 3 rounds, but he quickly gets bored. He leaves his toys all around the house for the rest of the family to find. </p>
